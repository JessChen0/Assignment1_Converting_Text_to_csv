## Approach

My approach for this assignment will be to:

1.  Load the txt file into R markdown file
2.  Understand player rating systems by reviewing the recording online
3.  Calculate "should be" pre rating of opponents for first few players
4.  Write R code to auto calculate pre tournament ratings for each player
